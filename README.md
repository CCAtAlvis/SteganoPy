# SteganoPy
A steganographic library built on PIL (Pillow)

## Usage
Take an image, provide its path, put your data, And run the file... you have the steganographed image ready.

## TODO:
- Convert stegano to proper class
- A simple key cipher
- Better usage of space by using 1 unused bit
- Compressing (probably simple Huffmann encoding) of the raw data
- Docs (whoever little maybe :p)
- Probably encrypt the data
